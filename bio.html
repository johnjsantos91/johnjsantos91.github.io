<p style="color:#c5c6c7; font-size:100%; text-align:center; font-family:American Typewriter;">The quote “Art is not what you see, but what you make others see” by Edgar Degas, echoes my own definition of what it means to be an artist.  
I believe being an artist means having the ability to create art pieces  that inspire people to act, start debates, empower movements and other important events, regardless of the medium.  One of the primary motivations behind my art pieces is my desire to tell a story, designed with empathy to create different connections with my audience.  Although it is a challenge, I am committed to sparking people’s imagination and perspective by welcoming their eyes and taking them on a journey through my series of art pieces.
<br>
<br> 
The driving force behind my body of work is my  enduring interest in expressing my thoughts and letting my imagination run wild.  Each of my art pieces is an attempt to  increase the dynamic between my artwork and the audience; by objectifying emotions and investigating the duality that develops through different interpretations.
<br>
<br>  
My body of work focuses on the importance of form and content.  To my mind, we often mistake form in art simply as a container that holds its contents together, however, audiences' may have different perspectives and reactions to an art piece.  Some will look at a piece of art and think of its narrative content, while others will critique it through their immediate unconscious reaction.  One way to look at form and content is to think of form as the structure, and content as the subject matter or meaning of the piece.  I enjoy creating art that is open to self interpretation.  I like to engage my viewers' reception of the work by supporting or undermining narratives, and hiding or understating a material.  I dare say, Good interpretations of art tell more about the artwork than they tell about the interpreter.
<br>
<br>
I am constantly searching for the best way to articulate my ideas through different mediums.  My projects do not solely focus on one medium, I find that using mixed media allows me to express different ideas.  I utilized different mediums in data bending, illustration, 2D/3D modeling, photography, coded art, constructing a website, as well as Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Premiere, and Adobe After Effects to create different art pieces that are interactive and engaging.  Creating videos, illustrations and 2D/ 3D figures allowed me to express deep and complex thoughts in sophisticated ways; this offers viewers an extensive array of visual stimuli to decipher.
<br>
<br>
Through these pieces, I was able to create a unique visual pictorial of my thoughts and imagination.  Each art piece is unique just as each viewer's experience of it is unique.  My goal is to create an art piece that will capture a person's curiosity and keep their attention drawn long enough until they generate their own self-interpretation and intellectual response.  Ultimately, If a viewer stops for just a moment to view and reflect on the art I have created, then I have fulfilled my objective.
